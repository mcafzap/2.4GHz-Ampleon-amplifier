# 2.4GHz-Ampleon-amplifier
The circuit is substantially taken from Ampleon's application note but uses an MSP430G2553 & an I2C connected display. Unfortunately the current measurement device chosen is now end-of life... but remains the best for resolving 6.25mA and measuring up to 25A. It monitors voltage & current of each stage and sets the bias of each stage.
Attempts were made to use a 3-D printed shield covered in copper tape but ultimately this was changed to a 'proper' aluminium case which can be nevertheless be made at home.
Output protection is provided by a 100W isolator from Bert Modderman (pe1rki.com)
A 30v, 10A supply is required.
